# Tetanus Dashboard Proposal
Author: Tanmay Agarwal <br>
My role: Data Scientist

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

## Target audience: Healthcare Professionals

Tetanus is a serious disease caused by bacteria that can lead to muscle stiffness, spasms, and in severe cases, death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tetanus is responsible for 59,000 deaths globally each year. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide healthcare professionals with a user-friendly platform to explore the global burden of tetanus, identify regions with high incidence rates, and monitor trends over time.

## Section 2: Description of the Data
I am using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) and WHO. The GBD provides data on the number of tetanus cases and deaths per million people for each country from 1974 to 2020. The WHO provides data on the incidence of tetanus and deaths due to tetanus for each country. The data is updated every year.

## Section 3: Research Questions
Our target user, Dr. Gupta, is a healthcare professional who is interested in understanding the global burden of tetanus and identifying regions with high incidence rates. He can use the slider to select a specific year and view a world map that shows the number of tetanus cases per million people in each country. He can also use the continent widget to focus on a specific region of the world. This will help Dr. Gupta identify regions with high incidence rates and potentially target interventions in those areas.

Dr. Gupta can also use the dropdown list to select a specific country and age group. He can then view a line plot of the number of deaths from tetanus in that country for the selected age group. This will help Dr. Gupta monitor trends over time and identify changes in the incidence of tetanus in that country. He can also switch between the GBD and WHO data to compare the incidence rates and death rates.

In addition to Dr. Gupta, the dashboard can be useful for healthcare professionals who want to monitor the global burden of tetanus and identify regions with high incidence rates. The dashboard can help them target interventions and monitor trends over time.
